\# React Product Catalog



A modern product catalog built with \*\*React\*\* and \*\*Vite\*\*, focused on clean component structure, state management, and a minimal, handcrafted UI.



The application allows users to browse products, filter and search items, manage a shopping cart, and add new products dynamically — all without relying on external UI libraries.
